# Simple fastify template.

## Instructions:
1.) Clone the repo

2.) Type `npm i` to install all dependencies

3.) Type `npm run dev` to make it autorecompile on changes, or type `npm run start` to just get it to start once

4.) As the console says, visit `http://127.0.0.1:3000` to check out your new API! I have setup a default route which you can configuire in src/routes/Default.ts

You can configure the port by creating a enviroment variable called `PORT` (You will have to setup dotenv manually), or just changing the port number in `src/index.ts`
